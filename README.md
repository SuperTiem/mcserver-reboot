# mcserver-reboot
This is a simpel script to run a minecraft server.
If you start the server with this script. beforeserver.sh The server will boot normaly but when the server closes you get a menu. Than you can choose to stop the server and or reboot. 

To set it up you need to change the server.jar text to your server file name. And you have to make the file executable.
